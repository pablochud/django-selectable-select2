django-selectable-select2
==========================

This project is a kind of a plugin for `django-selectable`_.

It provides widgets for use with a great JS library called `select2`_ rather than jQuery UI.
It also provides it's own Lookup classes for better (IMO) serialization results and limiting results (on server side).
